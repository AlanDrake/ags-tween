The Tween Module is a script module for [Adventure Game Studio (AGS)](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) that
can be used to script ["inbetweening"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbetweening). The module allows you to control many properties in GUIs, GUI controls, room objects, characters, audio, System, etc.
It allows these inbetweens to be blocking, non blocking, or to loop them, and it features
acceleration/deceleration easing functions.

This current module is compatible with AGS 3.0 and above. Version 1.x is also compatible with AGS 2.72 (and perhaps earlier versions) as well.
