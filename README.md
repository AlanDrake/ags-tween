# Tween Module for Adventure Game Studio

Tween is a script module for the game authoring program [Adventure Game Studio (AGS)](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/) that
can be used to create programmatic "tweens". Currently, it virtually everything
that can be adjusted by a number in AGS including GUIs, GUI elements, room objects, characters, audio, etc.
It allows these effects to be blocking, non blocking, or to loop them, and it features
acceleration/deceleration timing functions.

Tween is currently compatible with both AGS 2.72 (and perhaps earlier versions) and AGS 3.x.
